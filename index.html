				<h2 id="intro-logo">The Highlights Reel</h2>
				<p>The Goa Foundation was founded in the year 1986, celebrating its 25 years in 2011. These began with Goa's first public interest litigation on the protection of the sand dunes of Salcette. Eventually, the organisation has filed more than 100 PILs in the Bombay High Court (Panaji bench) and the Supreme Court of India. In between, there have been several major initiatives which the organisation undertook as part of its founding duty to protect the Goan environment from unnecessary harm. </p>
				<p>The “Highlights” provides a summary of the main events of those 25 years and beyond.</p>

Judgement on the petition was delivered by the Supreme Court's Green Bench on 21.4.2014.
